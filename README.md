# Spectrum

Spectrum has been my favorite side-project that I've made thus far. Music and technology go hand-in-hand forever.

I followed the example of Youtube user Cobalt and the tutorial of Youtube user N3K EN. The visualizer spawns cubes in realtime with the song and has some visual effects over it. The current song is an original mashup I created in Ableton.

Future goals:

    1) Add multiple colors, hence the name "Spectrum"
    2) Enhance song-selection functionality to be more robust.
